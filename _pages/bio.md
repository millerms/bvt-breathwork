I’m Jason Fitzgerald, an exercise physiologist and breathwork instructor trained with Oxygen Advantage and Nordic Flow. I hold certifications in FMS, NFPT CPT, and as a Nordic Flow cold plunge instructor.

My coaching is practical and evidence‑aware. I focus on gentle, nasal breathing, building CO₂ tolerance (Buteyko‑inspired), and controlled cyclic breathing with breath holds—always taught with clear safety options and pacing. Every session is tailored to you—paced just right, with intensity adjusted based on how you feel, and always giving you the freedom to opt out whenever you need.

Breathwork can be a helpful tool, but please work with your healthcare provider for any medical concerns and use breathwork as a supportive practice when it feels right for you.
