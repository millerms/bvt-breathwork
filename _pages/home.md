Welcome. This practice emphasizes simple, coachable breathing skills that
support calm, focus, and recovery. Sessions are paced to your comfort with
clear opt‑outs and intensity options.

I keep claims modest and name the quality of evidence. If a practice is new or
the literature is mixed, I’ll say so and adjust the intensity to fit you.
