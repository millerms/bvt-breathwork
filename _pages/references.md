We believe in transparency and the importance of grounding our practice in solid research. The references listed below offer a window into the science behind breathwork, inviting you to explore the evidence with both curiosity and discernment. Whether you are new to breathwork or deepening your understanding, these studies provide valuable insights to support your journey.

## Executive Summary

The references below highlight a growing body of evidence supporting breathwork for a range of health benefits. Research consistently points to the value of breathing practices in reducing stress and anxiety, improving mood, and supporting mental clarity. 

Studies also show links between breathwork, heart rate variability (HRV), cognitive function, and cardiovascular health. For people with asthma, certain techniques—like Buteyko—can be a helpful part of symptom management. Newer methods, such as the Wim Hof and A52 Breath Methods, are emerging with promising but still developing evidence for both psychological and physiological well-being. 

<em>As always, the science is evolving, and a gentle, informed approach is encouraged.</em>

## Notes

- Citations are here for transparency, not endorsement. I use neutral language in coaching.
- Some evidence is emerging or mixed. When in doubt, I encourage gentle, optional learning—with opt-outs always on the table.
