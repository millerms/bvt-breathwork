This practice brings together simple, easy-to-learn breathing skills with a strong focus on your comfort and control. I keep my claims realistic, share what the research says, and always encourage you to listen to your body—slow down or take a break whenever you need.

## Pillars

### Nasal‑dominant and slow‑paced breathing (~6 breaths/min)
- Why: To help you feel calm, balance your nervous system, and breathe more efficiently.
- How: Gentle breathing through your nose, often at a relaxed pace close to 6 breaths per minute.

> Evidence notes: Multiple RCTs and systematic reviews suggest slow breathing
> can support HRV, baroreflex function, and state anxiety. See the
> References page for representative sources.

### CO₂ tolerance work (Buteyko‑inspired)
- Why: To get comfortable with mild rises in CO₂, which can help reduce over‑breathing and give you more control.
- How: Light to moderate nasal breathing paired with short, easy breath holds.

> Evidence notes: Positive findings have been observed in asthma cohorts, and
> research in healthy adults is still emerging as protocols and outcomes are
> explored.

### Controlled cyclic breathing with breath holds
- Why: To support managing your energy and recovery, which can boost focus and resilience.
- How: Breathing patterns with deeper breaths and holds after exhaling, all taught with clear safety guidelines and options to pause. I keep things simple and neutral, avoiding any hype.

> Evidence notes: A 1‑month RCT found cyclic sighing with prolonged exhalation
> improved mood and lowered respiratory rate compared to other practices.
> Other physiological outcomes are still being explored in short-term studies.

### IHHT‑style concepts (intermittent hypoxia/hypercapnia)
- Why: Carefully guided exposure may help build tolerance and awareness. I only teach this gently, at an introductory level.
- How: Short, coached breath holds with plenty of gentle recovery breathing. Comfort, clarity, and screening are top priorities.

> Evidence notes: Evidence for these concepts is emerging, with promising early
> findings. Ongoing research continues to explore benefits and safety in healthy
> adults and specific populations.

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Your choice:</strong> You decide the pace, how intense it feels, and whether you sit or lie down.</li>
      <li><strong>Start easy:</strong> I begin gently and only increase intensity if it feels right for you.</li>
      <li><strong>Take breaks anytime:</strong> You’re welcome to pause or switch to easy nasal breathing whenever you want.</li>
      <li><strong>Stop if needed:</strong> If you feel dizzy, uncomfortable, or unwell, just return to easy breathing and rest.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep in mind:</strong> If you have heart or lung conditions, are pregnant, have a history of seizures, or other health concerns, please take extra care and seek medical advice.</li>

## What a session feels like
- A quick check-in to start. Gentle nasal breathing to settle in. Then I move into skills that fit your goals.
- Short practice segments with plenty of time to rest and recover between.
- A clear wrap-up with options to take what you’ve learned home with you.
